How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It let us know where the problem was located
    

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because you can easliy pull up a code for a problem 
    you are working on today that you might have encountered 
    years ago.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    1. you make the change pros
    2. you know when you saved pros


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To tie the files togather, one change affted each file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   You can see what date and when a file was changed
   
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can allways restore to a later version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For most if not all of my programs and online projects
